1 Starts a new game
2 Go over the controls and rules of the game
3 Exit the game (pressing escape at any screen will also always exit the game)
The controls and instruction screens will continue to the next menu after pressing any key.
Once you start a new game, the left and right arrow keys will rotate the aimer in the bottom center of the screen left and right, respectively.
Pressing the spacebar will launch the bubble at the base of the aimer in the direction of the aimer.
Winning or losing the game will trigger a corresponding message, and will return you to the main menu screen after pressing any key.
